## Overview

This project covers fundamental concepts in Java programming, focusing on different topics and activities spread across several weeks. Each week introduces new concepts and challenges to help reinforce your understanding of Java, from basic programming structures to more advanced topics such as arrays, string manipulation, and functions.


## Instructions

1. **Installation**: 
   - Ensure you have a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) installed.
   - Set up the environment by installing the latest version of JDK (Java Development Kit).

2. **How to Run**:
   - Open the Java project in your chosen IDE.
   - Each week's content is divided into its respective folder (Week 1 to Week 15).
   - Navigate to the corresponding week, review the code and instructions in the folder.
   - Compile and execute the Java files to test the programs.
