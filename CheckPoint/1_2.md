1. **Hardware and Software:**
   - **Hardware** refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can touch, like the keyboard, monitor, and motherboard.
   - **Software** is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. It's like programs or apps running on your computer.

2. **Five Major Hardware Components of a Computer:**
   - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
   - Memory (RAM)
   - Storage Devices (Hard Drive or SSD)
   - Input Devices (Keyboard, Mouse)
   - Output Devices (Monitor, Printer)

3. **What does CPU stand for? What unit is used to measure CPU speed?**
   - **CPU** stands for **Central Processing Unit**.
   - CPU speed is measured in **Hertz (Hz)**, usually in **Gigahertz (GHz)**.

4. **What is a bit? What is a byte?**
   - A **bit** is the smallest unit of data in a computer, representing a binary value (0 or 1).
   - A **byte** is made up of 8 bits and is the basic unit of data storage.

5. **What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?**
   - Memory is used to store data and instructions temporarily while the computer is running.
   - **RAM** stands for **Random Access Memory**.
   - Itâ€™s called **RAM** because the data can be accessed in any order (randomly) without waiting to reach a specific location.

6. **What unit is used to measure memory size? What unit is used to measure disk size?**
   - Memory size is measured in **Megabytes (MB)** or **Gigabytes (GB)**.
   - Disk size is also measured in **Megabytes (MB)**, **Gigabytes (GB)**, or **Terabytes (TB)**.

7. **What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?**
   - **Memory (RAM)** is temporary and volatile, meaning it only holds data while the computer is on.
   - **Storage devices** (like hard drives or SSDs) are non-volatile, meaning they keep data even when the computer is turned off.
