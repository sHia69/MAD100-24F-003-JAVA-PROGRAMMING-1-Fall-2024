1. **What language does the CPU understand?**
   - The CPU understands **machine language**, which is made up of binary code (0s and 1s). This is the most basic form of instructions that a computer can execute directly.

2. **What is an assembly language? What is an assembler?**
   - **Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that uses symbolic instructions instead of binary code, making it easier for humans to read and write compared to machine language.
   - An **assembler** is a program that converts assembly language code into machine language so the CPU can execute it.

3. **What is a high-level programming language? What is a source program?**
   - A **high-level programming language** is a language that is closer to human language, like Python, Java, or C++. It allows programmers to write instructions in a more understandable and efficient way.
   - A **source program** is the original code written by a programmer in a high-level language, before it is compiled or interpreted.

4. **What is an interpreter? What is a compiler?**
   - An **interpreter** is a program that translates high-level code into machine code **line by line** and executes it immediately.
   - A **compiler** translates the entire high-level source program into machine code **all at once**, creating an executable file that can be run later.

5. **What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?**
   - In an **interpreted language**, the code is executed directly by an interpreter without creating an intermediate file. The code is translated and run line by line (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
   - In a **compiled language**, the source code is first compiled into machine code, and then the compiled machine code is executed. This usually leads to faster execution (e.g., C, C++).
